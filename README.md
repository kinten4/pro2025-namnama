## 1.2 Team Management
With curious minds, small steps fueled by creativity and teamwork, our project is the result of our team's joint endeavor. As students from <a href="https://facebook.com/PCLUBasicEducationDepartment" target="_blank"><b>Polytechnic College of La Union (PCLU)</b></a> representing the Robotics Club in the category of Future Engineers, we applied our knowledge and skills in designing, building and programming a robot that emphasizes on creating innovative robot solutions. Throughout this journey, we learned the importance of perseverance and considering our own capabilities in doing such tasks to create a successful project.<br><br>

## 1.3 Reasons to Participate
For us, this project is more than just fighting for an honorable spot in the world of Robotics. It is more than just a competition. Here, we've indulged ourselves in discovering our fullest potentials by taking little steps and moving onto greater heights with full confidence and by enjoying the flow of the process. We've created a robot knowing it'll soon serve its purpose in the future.<br><br>Being a part of this Olympiad made us realize how great it is to seek answers or solutions for worldwide problems. The process also helped us realize how we should manage our talents/skills in the scope of Robotics. It is truly fascinating how a person can discoverâ€”such things about themselves while trying to discover for other people too.
